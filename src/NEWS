0.52	* Properly note in the nsslapd-pluginVersion attribute whether or
	  not transaction support is available.
	* Fix a pair of incorrect memcpy()-instead-of-memmove() cases which
	  would hit us when removing maps or groups of maps (#1043546).
0.51	* Miscellaneous fixes for bugs found during static analysis.
	* Fix another memory leak parsing request arguments, this time
	  in yp_all, which is exercised by ypcat.
0.50	* If the NIS server encounters an EPIPE while attempting to
	  communicate with the portmapper, try to reconnect before giving
	  up on registering.
0.49	* Add {nis,schema-compat}-ignore-subtree (ignore contents of
	  and updates to entries under the specified subtrees) and
	  {nis,schema-compat}-restrict-subtree settings (ignore contents
	  of and updates to entries outside of these subtrees) settings.
0.48	* Self-tests for new functionality and fixes for issues they found.
0.47.7	* Fix compile errors against older versions of directory server
	  which didn't supply slapi_escape_filter_value().
0.47.6	* Fix compile errors without libnss_sss_idmap.
0.47.5	* Add optional per-container schema-compat-lookup-nsswitch and
	  schema-compat-nsswitch-min-id settings, which supplement the
	  content of a set of compat entries with information from the
	  system on which the directory server is running.
0.47	* Fix memory leaks of request arguments in the NIS server.
	* Add a sort function.
0.46	* Fix detection of entries being modified so that they should be
	  added to or removed from maps (part of #912673).
	* Check SLAPI_PLUGIN_OPRETURN in postop hooks, in case the backend
	  failed but we're being called anyway.
0.45	* Fix dispatching for multiple connected clients (#923336).
0.44	* Packaging and logging fixes.

0.42	* Fix a memory leak (internal testing).
0.41	* Log errors evaluating pad expressions in %link rather than
	  continuing on until we hit an arithmetic exception (#810258).
0.40	* Treat the pad values passed to %link as expressions rather than
	  mere literal strings (part of #767372).
0.39	* Populate the entryUSN value in entries with either the value from
	  the source entry or the root DSE.
	* Add a default function (part of #767372).
0.38	* Properly escape RDN values when building compat entries (#796509).
0.37	* Fix a compile error on systems which don't define
	  LDAP_SCOPE_SUBORDINATE, reported by Christian Neuhold.
0.36	* Stop yp_first/yp_next from looping indefinitely when keys get
	  duplicated in NIS maps, at least for a single LDAP entry.
0.35	* Add mmatch,mregmatch[i],mregsub[i] functions (part of #783274),
	  which work like match,regmatch[i],regsub[i], but which handle
	  and return lists of zero or more values.
0.34	* Do entry comparisons ourselves, albeit less throughly, to avoid
	  the worst case in pathological cases (more of #771444).
0.33	* Actually compare pre- and post-modify entries to figure out if
	  a change is relevant (fixes a lot of #771444).
0.32	* Support for directory server's internal back-end transactions.
0.31	* Fix some memory leaks.
0.30	* Make a note of which attributes we read from any entry when
	  evaluating data, and when we're later called for a modify request
	  which doesn't modify any of those attributes, skip recalculating
	  the entry contents (should make a dent in #771493).
0.29    * Add regmatchi/regsubi formatting functions which work like
	  regmatch/regsub, but do matching in a case-insensitive manner.
	* Update NIS map defaults to match {CRYPT} userPassword values in a
	  case-insensitive manner so that we also use {crypt} userPassword
	  values.
	* Fix inconsistencies in the NIS service stemming from using
	  not-normalized DNs in some places where it should have used
	  normalized DNs.
0.28    * When building with OpenLDAP libraries, link with -lldap_r and
	  not with -lldap (rmeggins, #769107).
0.27    * Switch to slapi rwlocks instead of libpthread or NSPR rwlocks
	  (the rest of #730394/730403).
0.26    * Switch to libpthread rwlocks instead of NSPR rwlocks (part of
	  #730394/730403).
0.25    * Speed up building compat entries when they refer to thousands of
	  other entries (#694623).
0.24    * Buidl with either glibc's RPC or libtirpc.
0.23    * Speed up building compat entries with attributes with thousands
	  of literal values (#692690).
0.22    * Bug fixes.
	* Learn to build against either mozldap or openldap when building
	  for dirsrv servers.
0.21    * Make standalone container entries only show up in search results
	  once.
0.20    * Add a deref_f function which works like deref but also applies a
	  filter before reading the target attribute from the target entry.
0.19    * Fix a brown-paper-bag crash.
0.18    * Check that the search base is serviced by a real backend before
	  we'll attempt to participate in a search request.
	* Add a deref_rf function which works like deref_r but also applies
	  filters at each step of the way.
	* Do the more-or-less expected thing when a schema compat group
	  doesn't include a container RDN: assume the group DN is the only
	  container and make it standalone.
0.17    * Actually send portmap registrations to the right address.
0.16    * Fix NIS server startup problem when no listening port is explicitly
	  configured and we're using portmap instead of rpcbind (#500903).
0.15	* Avoid returning an empty-but-valid result when %deref and %referred
	  don't find anything, when they should be failing instead.
0.14	* Work correctly when nsslapd-pluginEnabled is set to "off" (#499404).
0.13	* Assorted fixes to %link() (#498432).
0.12	* Fix a crash introduced by a bug in the fix for the previous crash.
0.11	* Fix a crash while reading NIS maps with no entries (#497904).
0.10	* IPv6 support for the NIS server plugin.
	* Make the NIS server reject client requests which are too big.
	* Make the NIS defaults use recursive attribute functions.
	* Expanded docs, including a NEWS file.
0.9	* Added recursive attribute dereferencing using deref_r and referred_r.
	* Added conditional support (ifeq), and more merging functions (link,
	  collect).
	* More tests.
	* Entries supplied by the Schema Compatibility plugin now provide these
	  operational attributes:
	  * createTimestamp
	  * modifyTimestamp
	  * creatorsName
	  * modifiersName
	  * entryDN
	  * hasSubordinates
0.8	* Added a quick start guide for the Schema Compatibility plugin.
	* Tweak default format specifiers for the NIS Server plugin so that
	  we ensure that we only ever return UID and GID values which are
	  actually numbers.
0.7	* Teach the NIS Server plugin to be able to produce multiple NIS
	  map entries for a single directory server entry.
	* Make the Schema Compatibility plugin warn if a result set is empty.
	* Change match,regmatch,regsub to match against expressions, not just
	  attribute names.
